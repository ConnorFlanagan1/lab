// This is the comments for a linux lab changing permissions and privledges that I am learning.
// You now have practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to
// add a new user,
// add a user to a group,
// change user permissions on files, and
//delete a user.

//Task 1. Add a new user
//A new employee has joined the Research department. In this task, you must add them to the system. The username assigned to them is researcher9.
//Write a command to add a user called researcher9 to the system.
//Next, you need to add the new user to the research_team group.
//Use the usermod command and -g option to add researcher9 to the research_team group as their primary group.

sudo adduser researcher9

//passwrod 123


//Task 2. Assign file ownership
//The new employee, researcher9, will take responsibility for project_r. In this task, you must make them the owner of the project_r.txt file.
//The project_r.txt file is located in the /home/researcher2/projects directory, and owned by the researcher2 user.
//Use the chown command to make researcher9 the owner of /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt
cd /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt
sudo chown project_r.txt researcher9


//Task 3. Add the user to a secondary group
//A couple of months later, this employee's role at the organization has changed, and they are working in both the Research and the Sales departments.
//In this task, you must add researcher9 to a secondary group (sales_team). Their primary group is still research_team.
//Use the usermod command with the -a and -G options to add researcher9 to the sales_team group as a secondary group.
sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9

//Task 4. Delete a user
//A year later, researcher9, decided to leave the company. In this task, you must remove them from the system.
//Run a command to delete researcher9 from the system:
//sudo userdel researcher9
sudo userdel researcher9
//Userdel: Group researcher9 not removed because it is not the primary group of user researcher9.  
//This is expected.

\///delete the researcher9 group that is no longer required:
// in order to delete a user successfully if they are in a sub group
sudo groupdel researcher9
